    The Medium is the message is a phrase by a philosopher Marshall McLuhan. According to McLuhan, the Medium is the message means that the medium in which a message is communicated through has more influence than the message itself. (McLuhan, 1964) Nevertheless is the message’s relevance in influencing whoever is accessing it at that point, even if it is at an extent.

    To illustrate his theory and how much a medium can generally have influence. He takes listening to a message and reading the same message from a printing. He expresses that the printed words encourage an emphasis on the visual while hearing the same message being given orally makes the ear the dominant organ. (McLuhan, 1969).

    McLuhan developed his theory around his time, the 1960s using only mediums like television, radio and printing to test and prove his theory. Even though McLuhan did not live to see the internet or web that is this modern age mass medium, his theory can still be tested especially on such a multifaceted medium. The web is a combination of different types of mediums, people can access pictures, audio and text on it. 
    A lot of people consider the internet a place, some may say the internet is their favourite place. People can access the web anywhere and anytime with the use of usually a mobile device. Like most places, the internet has people, there is human virtual interaction, especially on social media networks. There are millions of people on Facebook today who can connect to one another all around the world.

<p>
    To understand the web and what this worldwide connection means for us and its influence we can look at McLuhan’s words when explaining his phrase around television, telephones and radio. McLuhan said such mediums unify and encourage participation amongst people. A sense of unity on the internet cannot be denied, with the revolution of the internet, there has been new phenomena like hashtags. Hashtags are tags that different people can use to access the same information. Recently here has been a liking amongst social media users to use them specifically for raising awareness for a particular cause. Hashtags do well playing that role because they can reach a huge amount of people in a short period of time, for example, #feesmustfall, #blacklivesmatter, etc.

<p>
    Campaign hashtags usually take the internet by storm, they can be seen being used by small accounts as well as very big accounts on social media. The web as a medium influence human behavior, a lot of people participated in #feesmustfall. One could argue if participation was because of the message for the majority of the people or did the reality of being a social media user just meant that they had to post, repost or retweet this hashtag like how people do hashtags.
    What does raising awareness mean? Why can a message not be sent to the relevant people? What does a lot of people uniting for a cause really do? What’s the influence?
    We can understand exactly how much a medium can have influence or how much its conventions like sharing a campaign hashtag can have influence an ordinary social media user’s behavior to conform. “It was the medium itself that shaped and controlled "the scale and form of human association and action” (McLuhan, 1964). This influence can even be seen on the relevant people in society that can make a difference towards the specific campaign. Arguably people care when it is on social media and would have probably acted  completely different if the fees must fall message was communicated through a traditional medium like radio for example. McLuhan impacts our understanding of the web, just how powerfula and influencial it can be.
